The Standard SDK contains several `.sol` files (smart contracts); the code is stored in our [github dc-contracts package](https://github.com/DaoCasino/dc-contracts). 
## GameChannel.sol
This is the game contract that applies your game logic to the standard session life-cycle (state change). It interacts with other auxiliary contracts (in particularly, with **GameObject.sol**) and game logic.

All amounts are defined in DAO.Casino BET Token (the coefficient is <a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=ether&space;\times&space;10^{18}" target="_blank"><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?ether&space;\times&space;10^{18}" title="ether \times 10^{18}" /></a>). 

Numeric values are [uint265](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/29946/what-is-uint256).

## SafeMath.sol
Implements safe math methods to protect from the risk of [overflow](https://ethereumdev.io/safemath-protect-overflows/).
## Interfaces.sol
Contains methods for interaction with other contracts. 
## GameObject.sol
This contract brings game data to the core game contract. 
## BlockMinder.sol & Migrations.sol

Used for environment testing.
