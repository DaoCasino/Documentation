## DApp Structure Overview
A sample DApp you get with the DC-CLI is actually a finished project with a sample game. To create a new game, you only have to change game-specific parameters related to your local project. 

Global variables and parameters are specified and stored in the DAO.Casino repository and many elements are imported from it. For more details, check readme.md files in it. 

In the table below you can find a brief description of the key files within a game (sample). 

| **Name**                                 | **Description**                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `dapp.logic.js`                          | Contains the game logic in the **play** function and the **customDataFormat** function; the latter is designed implement objects that store game data and custom parameters|
| `index.js` or `tutorial.js` | Integrates game elements from **dapp.logic.js**, **dapp.manifest** and **dc-webapi**; when called, applies methods to create a window and carry out a game session: **window.game.start**, **window.game.connect**, **window.game.play** with settings for two parties and **window.game.disconnect**. Note the **dc-webapi** (i.e. DAO.Casino protocol) is integrated via an asynchronous pattern. |
| `index.html`                             | Game frontend; calls the index.js where all game parameters are integrated and contains code to initiate key game stages: create account, open channel, play, close channel |
| `dapp.manifest.js`                       | Implements the logic for message exchange between a player and dealer (i.e. bankroller) and interaction with the game contract;|


Note that the **play** function is supposed to be as concise as possible to keep the transaction cost low, see also the chapter on [Gas price](https://github.com/DaoCasino/Documentation/2.%20Developer%20Sandbox/2.7.-Notes-on-Transaction-Pricing-(Gas)).
### Mandatory Parameters of Dapp.manifest.js

| **Name** | **Description**           |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| `name` or `slug`  | unique game name          |
| `logic`  | path to the dapp_logic.js |

## How to Create your Game from Sample

1. Install the DC-CLI/bankroller.
2. Clone the example application at [dc-sdk-example](https://github.com/DaoCasino/dc-sdk-example).
3. Clone dc-webapi by calling `npm -i` in the folder with the example.
4. Open the folder where your game sample is installed.
5. Enter your game logic into **dapp.logic.js** file (the **play** function). 
5. Open the **tutorial.js** file. 
This is the file where the game session life-cy—Åle is configured. Basically, the life-cycle includes five stages represented by five methods called one after another:  
- init - session setup when an account is created, integration with the protocol carried out:  
```javascript
 const webapi = await new DCWebapi({
                  platformId: platform_id,
                  blockchainNetwork: that.DC_NETWORK
                }).start()
window.webapi = webapi
webapi.account.init(WALLET_PWD, playerPrivateKeys[DC_NETWORK]) 
```  
You have to specify DC_NETWORK in the same file (it is the blockchain network you want to use, e.g. Ropsten).  
- create - session setup when a game calls to the contract.  Mind the rules: bankroller balance is supposed to exceed the player's 5-fold:  
```javascript
window.game = window.webapi.createGame({ 
    name: manifest.slug, 
    contract: manifest.getContract(DC_NETWORK), 
    gameLogicFunction: dapp, 
    rules: manifest.rules 
  })
```
- start, no developer action expected:
```javascript
await window.game.start()
```
- connect - the script connects to the room and selects an available bankroller: 
```javascript
await window.game.connect({ 
          playerDeposit: deposit, 
          gameData: [0, 0] 
        }) 
 ```
- play - this is the point where your **play** function is called and actual arguments are applied to your logic. Note that **randomRanges** and **gameData** are mandatory parameters, **custom** is optional, but it is strongly recommended to use it. As you can see parameters are implemented as array objects allowing you to, e.g., define multiple bets in your game:
```javascript
  const res = await game.play({
    userBets: [1],
    gameData: {
      // required
      randomRanges:[[1, 3], [1, 3], [1, 3]],
      // any your game data
      custom: { playerNumbers:[1, 2, 3] }
    }
  })
 ```
- disconnect - session ends either when  the game ends and funds are distributed or when the Internet connection is lost. 
```javascript
window.game.disconnect()
```

## General Game  Session Life-Cycle Implemented by DApp

1. A player calls the `approve` function of an `ERC20` contract allowing the game contract to deposit a specific amount of player funds.
2. Our DC-WEBAPI is initiated in the player browser by the game `name` via [`dc-messaging`](https://github.com/DaoCasino/dc-messaging). It receives requests from available bankrollers and chooses the one with the largest balance to avoid a situation when a bankroller fails to support the  bid.
3. The player front-end application makes a request to the selected bankroller providing data and a private key signature.
4. The  bankroller checks the data and opens the channel.
5. The game contract (muti-sig contract) freezes bankroller and player funds.
6. The player and the bankroller play in an off-chain mode.
7. The player ends the game session.
8. The bankroller checks game data and closes the game channel. The game smart contract unfreezes and distributes funds between the player, the bankroller, the operator, the referrer and the game developer  according to the existing settings.
