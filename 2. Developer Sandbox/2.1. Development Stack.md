DAO.Casino provides a comprehensive gamedev kit with a sample viable game in it. 

Note that you still have to install the bankroller application (see below) to have a comprehensive SDK.

The DAO.Casino SDK contains:
- a set of files to implement the game logic and a sample of viable game for front-end developers; it is available for training and customization in our console.

- bankroller application (casino backend)

- integrated smart contracts (protocol, game back-end)
- DC-CLI that guides you through the whole project

Below you can find detailed deployment guidelines.

## Note on Code
Our solution uses Solidity for smart contracts, TypeScript for core components and game logic. You may also use JavaScript in your projects. 
# Deployment

## Preconditions

The developer kit is based on truffle framework, so you need to install the following:

- node.js (1o or newer)
- npm.js

For **Windows** you need Bash Terminal with installed windows-build-tools; call: ```javascript npm install --global windows-build-tools``` and ```javascript  npm i -g node-gyp``` to compile node.js addons

For Mac OS install:xcode-select --install

For Linux install gcc utility by calling: sudo apt install gcc

For **Mac OS** install: ```javascript xcode-select --install```

For **Linux** install gcc utility by calling: ```javascriptsudo apt install g```

## DC-CLI Deployment 
You can install our wizard for easier and smoother deployment. To do it, call (wizard installation):
```javascript
npm i -g dc-cli
```
When the wizard starts, it displays the list (menu) of commands you have to call in order to successfully deploy the SDK and use it. 

The recommended procedure and command particularities are covered in a [separate chapter](2.2.%20DC-CLI%20and%20Dev%20Environment.md).

# Bankroller App Deployment

Clone the mono repository. Then call:

`npm i -g bankroller-core`

To start the application, call:

``bankroller-core start <privateKey> [options]``

## Optional Procedure for Windows

1. Install GIT Bash. Call all commands in this console. Launch it as the local administrator. 
2. Install Node.js (version 10 or newer).
3. Install Docker. If your OS is not from the Pro/Enterprise family or its version is below Windows 10, install the [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/#whats-in-the-box).
4. Clone the DAO.Casino repository.
5. Navigate to the core repository directory and call `npm install --global windows-build-tools.` This command installs components necessary for Windows, and ```javascript  npm i -g node-gyp``` to compile node.js addons
6. Call `yarn install` in the same directory. In case of conflicts, install manually.
7. Once complete, call `yarn build`. 

All parameters are specified at ../src/bin/deamon.ts. 

## Troubleshooting 

Overall, the deployment kit is very solid and error-proof, but, If you have problems deploying the SDK, check the following:
- node.js version
- npm status
- conflicts with other networks deployed on your PC
- Internet access
- browser plugins, Windows antivirus software blocking the process
- etc.

After a series of tests, you are likely to exhaust test balances available for each account. To rest the test accounts:

in dc-cli call:

`reset`

or call:

`npm run reset`
